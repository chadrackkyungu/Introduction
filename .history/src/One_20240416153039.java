         * [Case Sensitivity]: Java is case-sensitive, which means that identifiers such
         * as variable names and class names distinguish between uppercase and lowercase
         * letters.
         * 
         * [Class Names]: For all class names, the first letter should be in Upper Camel
         * Case. Example: MyFirstJavaClass.
         * 
         * [Method Names]: All method names should start with a lowercase letter. If
         * several words are used to form the name of the method, each inner wordâ€™s
         * first letter should be in Upper Camel Case. Example: myMethodName().
         * 
         * [Program File Name]: The name of the program file should exactly match the
         * class name. When saving a file, you should save it using the class name
         * (Remember that Java is case-sensitive) and append .java to the end of the
         * name. Example: MyFirstJavaClass.java.
         * 
         * [Main Method Entry Point]: Every Java application must contain a main()
         * method,
         * which is the entry point for the program.

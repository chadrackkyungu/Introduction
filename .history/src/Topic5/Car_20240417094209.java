/* *********Product Inventory Management System **********/

/*
 * 
 * You are tasked with developing a small part of an inventory management system for an e-commerce platform to help manage products more efficiently. The requirements are as follows:

Product Definition: Define a class Product that can represent any item in the inventory with the following attributes:

productId (String): a unique identifier for the product
name (String): the name of the product
price (double): the current price of the product
quantityAvailable (int): how many units of the product are currently in stock
Behavioral Requirements:

Implement a method to update the price of the product.
Implement a method to process the sale of the product, which decrements the quantity available by one each time a sale is made. Ensure the method checks if the product is in stock before a sale is processed.
Implement a method to display the productâ€™s details in a user-friendly format.
Operational Scenario:

Create an instance of the Product class with a specified id, name, price, and quantity.
Display the initial state of the product.
Process a sale and then display the new state of the product.
Update the price of the product and show the final state.
The system should be robust enough to handle incorrect updates (e.g., setting an earlier year for a product release should be rejected).

Develop the class with appropriate methods and test it in a main method simulating these operations.
